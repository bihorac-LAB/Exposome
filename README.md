# Exposome Data Linkage Tool

## Background and Introduction

Exposome data refers to the comprehensive collection and integration of information representing an individual's or population's exposure to environmental, social, and lifestyle factors, including Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). These datasets are increasingly important for clinical research worldwide. However, because they are collected and maintained by different organizations, there is no centralized, unified database that allows researchers to quickly access, visualize, and download reliable data.

This project addresses the following needs:

1. A GIS-enabled database to store geospatial data  
2. Efficient data ingestion with minimal manual effort  
3. A lightweight web application for data cataloging, visualization, and basic analysis  
4. Local geocoding toolkits for converting addresses to coordinates or FIPS codes

## Database Design

We use **PostgreSQL** with the **PostGIS** extension to support geospatial operations. Inspired by the [OHDSI GIS Working Group](https://github.com/OHDSI/GIS), our database includes core tables to store both geospatial and variable data.  

Key design elements:

* **`data_source` table:** Stores metadata from all source datasets, including SDoH, environmental data, and geometry data.  
* For each SDoH and environmental dataset, two tables are created:  
  - **`variable_index` table:** Captures attributes and properties of each variable  
  - **`variable_value` table:** Stores variable values linked to geocoded locations  
* Geospatial data is stored in dedicated tables and linked to variables using geoCodes such as FIPS, ZCTA, COUNTY, and STATE

## Toolkits

Most SDoH datasets use Census Tract (FIPS) boundaries. To support investigators, we provide **toolkits** to geocode source addresses into coordinates or FIPS codes.  

To protect patient privacy, geocoding should be executed **locally**. Our toolkit supports both:

- CSV file input  
- Direct extraction from OMOP CDM databases  

> If your institution already provides geocoding services, you may skip these toolkits.

### Web Application

We developed a [web application](https://exposome.rc.ufl.edu/) that provides investigators with:

- A data catalog  
- The exposome data linkage tool  
- Data visualization features  

A basic data analysis tool will be included in the next release.  

The web application is deployed on [HiPerGator](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/about/hipergator/) PubApps.
